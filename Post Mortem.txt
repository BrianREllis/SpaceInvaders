	The most difficult part of any project for me has been getting started. On this project, I had an extremely difficult time getting my character to move (even though I had the pong game to work with and copy...). I tend to get much more frustrated if I cant make the initial game work, I need to feel like I'm making some form of progress.

	That being said, with the help I got, I feel like I'll have a much easier time starting going forward. I learned, or rather got a much better understanding of what constructors are, how to use headers and multiple source files and how to use more functions from the SFW libraries. With that little bit of extra understanding I should be able to progress quickly through the beginning of the game and feel more excited about the project I want to work on, which will then drive me to learn more.
